This mod will create both Corruption and Crimson on any world created while it is enabled!

NEW UPDATE - V 3.0
-Both evil biome chests now generate in the dungeon!
-ACTUALLY (hopefully) fixed the issue where world generation would get stuck at corruption pits.
-Fixed a crashing bug where the world would only generate if the dungeon was on a specific side.
-Generating worlds should be way more stable overall.

NEW UPDATE - V 2.1
- Potentially fixed issue where world generation would get stuck at corruption pits

NEW UPDATE - V 2.0
-Completely overhauled the way the mod works
-Both evils now spawn proportionate to eachother, e.g if 4 corruption chasms would spawn in vanilla, 2 corruptions and 2 crimsons would spawn with this mod
-Currently both evils generate close to those of the same type, with one type on one side of the world and the other on the other side. (Will likely add a toggle for this later)
-Both types of altars now spawn
-Fixed some generation issues

NEW UPDATE - V 1.2
-Added an icon

NEW UPDATE - V 1.1
-Fixed Crimson Hearts only spawning
-The world is now set to whatever was originally set (If you select Corruption, it will count as Corruption for EoC drops etc)
