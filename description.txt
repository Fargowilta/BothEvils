This mod will create both Corruption and Crimson on any world created while it is enabled, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff to allow you to do everything concerning both evils in once world!


NEW UPDATE - V 3.0
-- Generation
-Both evil biome chests now generate in the dungeon!
-You can have both evil biomes generate during hard mode!

-- New Item
- Key of Flight: Craft using 15 souls of flight, place in a chest and you'll be able fight the other evil biome's mimic!

-- Drops
- Eye of Cthulhu: drops both evil's drops at the same time in normal mode, expert mode however only gives one or another evil's drops randomly per treasure bag.
- Dryad: Now sells both evil's seeds and powders during a blood moon.
- Steampunker: Now sells both evil's clentaminator solutions during a blood moon or solar eclipse.

-- Config
-You can now toggle if you want the biomes to avoid eachother or to just be placed randomly around the world in the config. Avoiding eachother is the default.
-Both evil biomes generating in hard mode is a toggle for players that want more challenge. It defaults to off.

-- Bug Fixes
-ACTUALLY (hopefully) fixed the issue where world generation would get stuck at corruption pits.
-Fixed a crashing bug where the world would only generate if the dungeon was on a specific side.
-Generating worlds should be way more stable overall.
